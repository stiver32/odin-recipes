                <li>1 cup jasmine rice</li>
                <li>1 head cauliflower cut</li>
                <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>kosher salt and pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup roasted peanuts</li>
                <li>1 cup snow peas</li>
                <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 tbsp chopped ginger</li>
                <li>3 scallions cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup cilantro</li>
            </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the broiler. Cook the rice as the label directs. Meanwhile, toss the cauliflower with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper; spread on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil, stirring occasionally, until lightly charred and tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the peanuts and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Remove to a small bowl with a slotted spoon and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Add the snow peas, bell pepper and ginger to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the scallions (white and green parts) and cauliflower; toss. Add the chili sauce and soy sauce and continue to cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are glazed, about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Fluff the rice with a fork; top each serving with the stir-fry, toasted peanuts and cilantro.</li>
                </ol>
